Hi all,

I know everyone is talking about the Destiny 2 loot pool right now. Season of the Hunt brought about the first big wave of weapon sunsetting, and we’ve lost the ability to use tons of our favorites in light level-restricted activities.

I’ll save my thoughts on that situation for another day, but I did spend some time thinking a bit about what options we will have in front of us this season. While many players are understandably frustrated, the current loot pool is far from worthless. There are a number of weapons I’m pretty excited about, and I wanted to write quick breakdowns of a few of my targets.

For the purposes of this post, I decided to confine myself to legendary gear, and to bypass the new raid weapons until we’ve all had a chance to get ahold of them and see how they actually feel. I’m sure that we’ll eventually discover new options and gain a clearer sense of the meta. In the meantime, I’ve tried to be broad in my recommendations, and also to comment here on things like personal preference and the differences between MnK and controller; I play on controller, so PC players can probably swap out stability-oriented perks for other combos.

I’d definitely love to hear from people below. Sound off if you have alternatives to my rolls, suggestions for other weapons that are worth chasing, or any other comments!

**1. Stars in Shadow (340 RPM Solar Pulse Rifle)**

This season, 340 Pulses have only become more relevant to the meta, and this weapon is no exception. Stars in Shadow has a bunch of excellent options, from PvP-friendly perks like Quickdraw, Snapshot, and Headseeker, to PvE powerhouse combos such as Outlaw/Kill Clip and Feeding Frenzy/Dragonfly. I was lucky enough to land an Outlaw/Kill Clip roll during an early comp session. At least from a perk standpoint, I would say this gun is most ideal for tearing down ads with damage perks like Kill Clip or Dragonfly. Even so, it definitely has some solid Crucible options for players who didn’t have a chance to grab a Cold Denial last season. This archetype is pretty stable right out of the box, so even console players can elect for a mix of stability and range.

**Recommended Roll:**

* Chambered Compensator/Tactical Magazine
* Outlaw/Kill Clip
* Range MW

**Alternative Perks:**

* *Column 1*: Killing Wind/Quickdraw/Firmly Planted/Feeding Frenzy
* *Column 2*: Dragonfly/Snapshot/Headseeker/Moving Target/Demolitionist/Vorpal Weapon
* *Masterworks*: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload

**2. Artic Haze (720 RPM Solar Auto Rifle)**

While 720 RPM autos have been overshadowed by their more trendy cousins in the 600 RPM family, 720s (Rapid-Fire Frame) are excellent weapons in both PvE and PvP. The archetype actually has a more forgiving body shot TTK in Crucible, and they absolutely melt ads. One of my most used weapons this year was Garden of Salvation’s Reckless Oracle, and Artic Haze will slide right alongside it in my PvE arsenal; I was absolutely thrilled to see this weapon rolls with Dragonfly, one of my favorite ad clear perks in the game. I’ve built the following roll around the perks I’ll be hunting. Console players will definitely want to prioritize decent stability, as these guns have a bit of kick.

**Recommended Roll:**

* Chambered Compensator/Tactical Magazine
* Outlaw/Dragonfly
* Range MW

**Alternative Perks:**

* *Column 1*: Subsistence/Killing Wind/Mulligan
* *Column 2*: Vorpal Weapon/Eye of the Storm
* *Masterworks*: Range, Stability, Handling

**3. Coriolis Force (Void Fusion Rifle)**

Sunsetting has left a big gap in the fusion rifle family. There are a number of solid options out there, but I didn’t really feel like I landed anything last season that quite lives up to favorites like Erentil or Wizened Rebuke. This weapon has potential to be the new go-to legendary fusion in Crucible: it’s got an excellent set of perks–especially Rangefinder and the newly added Thrush–so I suspect players will catch on to its potential as a legendary alternative to exotics like Bastion and Telesto.

**Recommended Roll:**

* Hammer-Forged Rifling/Projection Fuse
* Moving Target/Rangefinder
* Range MW

**Alternative Perks:**

* *Column 1*: Under Pressure, Feeding Frenzy, Killing Wind
* *Column 2*: Thresh/One For All/Unrelenting Wind
* *Masterworks*: Range, Stability, Handling

**4. Royal Chase (180 RPM Void Scout Rifle)**

Scout rifles have been in a rough place for a while, but the buff to scout aim assist has made them more viable in all game modes, PvE in particular. There are a handful of excellent options out there right now, particularly the 200 RPM kinetic Night Watch that was reintroduced last season. There is still a strong need for a light level-relevant energy option, and this weapon fills the void left behind after the sunsetting of 180 RPM reliables like No Feeling and Oxygen. Console players will still want to elect for solid range, which will help guarantee you nab those precision shots.

**Recommended Roll:**

* Hammer-Forged Rifling/Flared Magwell
* Full Auto Trigger System/Multikill Clip
* Range MW

**Alternative Perks:**

* *Column 1*: No Distractions
* *Column 2*: Dragonfly/Quickdraw/Thresh
* *Masterworks*: Range, Stability, Reload

**5. Thermal Erosion (900 RPM Solar Machine Gun)**

When fans point to the limitations in the current loot pool, machine guns are usually the first weapon they mention; sunsetting has hit this category harder than almost any other, meaning that new options are urgently needed. Thermal Erosion is one of the few new weapons that can fill the gap, and thankfully, it comes with a great perk pool that will appeal in any mode or on any system. I’ve recommended two options, one for PvE ad clear and another for PvP. If I’m lucky, I’ll be stashing both!

**Recommended Roll:**

*PvE*:

* Arrowhead Break/Flared Magwell
* Quickdraw/Dragonfly
* Stability MW

*PvP*:

* Hammer-Forged Rifling/High-Caliber Rounds
* Quickdraw/Tap the Trigger
* Range MW

**Alternative Perks:**

* *Column 1*: Zen Moment/Killing Wind
* *Column 2*: Dynamic Sway Reduction/Demolitionist/Snapshot Sights
* *Masterworks*: Stability, Range, Handling, Reload
