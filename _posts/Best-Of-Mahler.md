I’m kind of in the zone with making lists right now. I thought it would be interesting to make a list of my favorite recordings of each of the Mahler symphonies. I’m a huge Mahler fan and have thought a lot about his music for years. Honestly though, the idea for doing this mostly came about as I started sorting through my recordings to figure out what was worth hogging up space on my aging iPod classic. The song cycles will have to wait for another day.

Very quickly, here is the closest I’ve got to a general philosophy of Mahler recording. I’m pretty picky with his stuff. Many conductors turn Mahler into pseudo-Wagnerian fluff. Everything gets slowed down and overwrought, as if the Grail knights took a detour through the Alps setting their oaths to Ländlers. Others overcorrect this tendency, trying to simplify Mahler’s music in a way I find equally disappointing. While I’m a big fan of HIP(-ish) recordings of late 19th century century rep (eg. Harnoncourt & Fischer’s Bruckner), that approach generally feels too rigid for me when brought to bear on Mahler. Time and again, I’d choose Mitropoulos’s quirky 1940 first with Minnesota over Fischer’s bureaucratic read of the same.

Because of this, I have a big slant toward sixties performances by the likes of Kubelik, Solti, Klemperer, and Bernstein. I think they strike a great balance between the early Wild West years of Mahler recording and some of the more dominant approaches in recent years. Conductors in that era were willing push the boundaries in the service of a reading. And I usually can get behind them. For this reason, sixties records are dominant in what follows.

Anyway, here goes:
