Bungie recently put out a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49676" target="_blank">TWAB detailing the sandbox changes</a> that are coming to Destiny 2 with the Beyond Light expansion. Obviously, a lot remains TBD, especially until we see what sorts of weapons/perks will be available. Even so, I’m excited by the changes, and have been trying to think ahead about Light Level-relevant weapons that might be worth taking for a spin on day 1.

I decided to write up some of my thoughts on primary weapons, with some recommendations of archetypes or specific weapons to mess around with. Some of these predictions are geared toward the meta, while I expect other weapons on my list will only be prominent with more casual players in low-stakes settings. Either way, I think we're in for a shift in terms of what people are using in bottom- and top-tier gameplay.

A lot of my research was aided by the <a href="https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/blog/2017/9/21/destiny-2-massive-breakdown-weapon-stats-spreadsheet" target="_blank”>Destiny Massive Breakdowns spreadsheet</a>, which I’m sure most users here are familiar with. Because I wanted to keep this from getting any longer than it is, I don’t spend a lot of time reviewing all of the sandbox changes.
<br>
<br>
<b>Overview</b>
<br>
<br>
Generally, I’m optimistic about the upcoming changes. While the alterations aren't seismic, I do expect this to shift to one of the most balanced sandboxes we’ve had in a while. Nerfs to auto rifles and hand cannons mean a somewhat lower and generally more even TTK for popular weapons–hovering above or below .8 seconds for a number of prominent archetypes, including 600 RPM autos, 140 RPM hand cannons, 450 RPM pulses, and 150 RPM scouts.

These changes also hint at a decline in use of spray-and-pray weapons like Gnawing Hunger and Hard Light, ones that are best-suited to short- and mid-range encounters. As a result, I expect to see a shift away from the mid-range game that became pretty popular in the last two seasons, something that was especially facilitated by the popularity of auto rifles. Also relevant here is the nerf to snipers; it isn’t a game-breaker, but it will inspire people to step out of cover with a tad more confidence. Both changes potentially open up the game for mid-long-range primaries like scouts, pulses, and even bows.

If I’m on the right track, this means it’s worth thinking a bit about the weapons that fit your skillset and playstyle. Will you stick with hand cannons, which rely on precision shooting and cover-peaking? Or, are you going to lean more on pulses, which are much more forgiving compared to other classes of weapons? Or, will you turn to sidearms as a sturdy backup for long-range options like a sniper?

I also expect that the hollowing out of the mid-range paves the way for a close-range, high pressure playstyle. Shotguns will remain powerful, as will fusions and lightweight grenade launchers. The short-range primary front has a number of strong options to try out; now that an auto can’t melt you, there are a number of interesting choices for close engagements.

Long story short, my predictions for the meta are the continuing prominence of favorites like Thorn, Dire Promise, and The Last Word, paired with an even more prominent role for guns like Traveler's Chosen, Cold Denial, Crimson, Ace of Spades, Sunshot, Sacred Provenance, MIDA Multi-Tool, Jade Rabbit, and Vigilance Wing.

Here are my other thoughts:
<br>
<br>
<b>1. Hand Cannons</b>
<br>
<br>
Let’s get started with hand cannons, which have to be one of the most interesting restructures in the upcoming sandbox. I expect hand cannons to remain relevant on all systems. The removal of 150s does weaken the whole class, but they retain value for their high damage-per-shot and utility in cover. The decline of autos and the increase to hand cannon range also helps them retain their value as an all-around weapon. I don’t have high hopes for 180 HCs, but 140s and 120s will be competitive with mid-long-range weapons and as players close the gaps. My guess is that the Dire Promise-Felwinter’s Lie combo is far from dead.
<br>

<b>Recommendations:</b>

<ul>
<li><b>Thorn & Ace of Spades</b> – I suspect both of these weapons will be popular choices, with Thorn’s Mark of the Devourer and Ace’s Memento Mori providing distinctive advantages. Each is deadly, making these two potential best-in-class exotics.</li>
<li><b>140 RPM Hand Cannons</b> – It will be interesting to see if legendary 140s like Ancient Gospel or Nation of Beasts become more popular, and also whether or not Bungie shifts their approach to perks on the archetype. Either way, this already solid cluster will no longer be overshadowed by 150s, meaning that there is a lot of value in strong rolls.</li>
<li><b>120 RPM Hand Cannons</b> – Thanks to a buff, this archetype will be relevant in Beyond Light. A high impact and solid range mean these weapons are contenders, as will perks like Explosive Payload (e.g. Crimil’s Dagger) and Timed Payload (e.g. True Prophecy).</li>
<li><b>Sunshot & Crimson</b> – Next season, Sunshot will be the last 150 RPM left standing. With a high TTK, intrinsic lightweight frame, and Explosive Payload, the weapon will be very competitive. Crimson was great before, and it remains a power-house. With an amazing stability on console and an optimal TTK of .87, it’s only going to become more competitive.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>2. Scout Rifles</b>
<br>
<br>
I don’t expect scouts to become particularly dominant, but alterations to their AA cone and overall shifts to the meta will potentially let these guns shine a bit more. 150 Scouts will have a faster TTK than the fastest legendary hand cannons (140 RPMs), and also offer solid range and good perks. Smart positioning and good shooting can make this into a valuable option.

<b>Recommendations:</b>

<ul>
<li><b>MIDA Multi-Tool</b> – I’m sure everyone is excited about this weapon, which has faded in the last year. I expect to see it a lot in week one; if it’s at all crispy, it might still be there at the end of the season. Legendary 200 RPMs like Night Watch might also have some sleeper value as a non-Exotic alternative. Their .9 TTK is not too shabby, and they have an intrinsic Lightweight perk with a solid perk pool.</li>
<li><b>Jade Rabbit</b> – There has been a lot of chatter about the 150 RPM exotic scout rifle Jade Rabbit. The inclusion of High-Cal Rounds offers potential value in long-range duels; now that Gnawing Hunger can’t cross-map scout users, I expect to see people trying out this one or its Energy slot rival, Polaris Lance.</li>
<li><b>150 RPM Scout Rifles</b> – Thanks to their solid TTK of .8 seconds, I expect to see people trying out legendary 150s, too. I’ve been sleeping on nice rolls of The Scholar and Talons of the Eagle, and am looking forward to seeing how they compete. There are lots of interesting perks on some of the legendary 150s, many of which account for the slow feel of the archetype.</li>
<li><b>Symmetry</b> – Randy's Throwing Knife was the only scout I ever really took out this season. Symmetry is its Energy cousin, and I expect this exotic to be even more common in 6v6. It has to be one of the most forgiving weapons in my whole list, so I could see it getting some traffic with displaced auto users.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>3. Pulse Rifles</b>
<br>
<br>
This group of weapons is the one I’m most excited about. Pulses have potential to be major players. While there were no major changes to any of them, some pulse archetypes have competitive range and excellent TTKs. Their burst fire also means that they will continue to be the more forgiving alternative to hand cannons and scouts, so I expect many auto users to convert.

<b>Recommendations:</b>

<ul>
<li><b>High-Impact Pulse Rifles (340 RPM)</b> – This archetype received a buff for Season of Arrivals, so it was already very strong. Like many other weapons, it will have a bit more breathing room next season. If you can hit your shots, this gun has the potential to be a truly dominant primary.</li>
<li><b>Aggressive Burst Pulse Rifles (450 RPM)</b> – With a TTK of .73, this archetype will effectively become one of the fastest weapons in the game when the new update is live. Right now, Sacred Providence is a potential go-to, especially since Garden of Salvation has been such a popular raid this year. It’s likely that players have stashed powerful combos like Rapid Hit/Kill Clip or Rangefinder/Snapshot Sights, but I’m hopeful Bungie will introduce others.</li>
<li><b>Vigilance Wing</b> – Like 340s, this weapon has been getting some traffic already. Here’s another instance where the hollowing out of the middle range might really bring a gun to the foreground. It’s got a solid TTK and great perks, so I’m looking forward to using it even more next season.</li>
<li><b>Adaptive Pulse Rifles (390 RPM)</b> – While Bygones is getting sunset at the end of the season, there are a number of solid 390 RPM pulses that have been reintroduced this year. The buffs to 340s might overshadow this archetype–which has a noticeably slower .93 TTK–but Adaptives are much more forgiving. Jian 7 and Last Perdition both roll with really excellent combos, such as Zen Moment/Rangefinder on the one, Moving Target/Headseeker on the other.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>4. Close-Range Primaries</b>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to throw in a grab-bag of primaries that will be interesting to consider for the short game. As I mentioned above, the nerf to autos potentially means that more players will be shifting to cautious lane positioning and longer-range weapons. That in turn opens up the door for players who like a high-pressure, in-your-face playstyle, overwhelming players who won't have anything suited to close distance. While the Ape approach will continue to reward shotgunners, there are a number of weapons I expect to be very handy as backups.

<b>Recommendations:</b>

<ul>
<li><b>Traveler’s Chosen/300 RPM Sidearms</b> – Traveler’s Chosen has already attracted a lot of fans. It’s a standout example of an archetype that, while not tremendously popular, has long had a number of diehards. If Bungie introduces even more 300 RPM options to replace the .6 second TTK of guns like Drang and Translation Theory, I expect them to be very relevant. (Don’t sleep on Rat King or Devil’s Ruin either!)</li>
<li><b>The Last Word</b> – It isn’t a hot take to say The Last Word might be popular, but this gun is only going to be more central to the meta next season. I’ve lost a lot of 1v1s to TLW users, even while running Drang or Gnawing Hunger. Take them off the table, and this weapon could be highly dominant.</li>
<li><b>SUROS Regime</b> – Yes, another “hot take,” I know. I’m really interested to see how this weapon feels, given the nerf to TTK and the potential rise of other weapons. I suspect it will still be a solid option, especially because the exotic perk keeps it near the TTK top end of relevant weapons. It’s also a clutch weapon well-suited to low-mid-range, so I’m going to hold onto mine for a bit.</li>
<li><b>Cerberus</b> – My actual hot take, or at least lukewarm take, is that this gun is worth taking out of the vault. If I’m right that there is space for a smothering close-range build, Cerberus might be a great partner to a special weapon. With a .67 TTK and little to oppose it, I’m expecting this gun will pair nicely with a shotgun-driven playstyle.</li>
</ul>
