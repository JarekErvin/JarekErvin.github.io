Here is the text of a talk I’ll be giving this week at the AMS/SMT Joint Meeting in Vancouver. The paper is part of a panel on Historical Materialism, featuring some friends and people I really admire in the field (Bryan Parkhurst, Stephan Hammel, Sumanth Gopinath, Naomi Waltham-Smith, Eric Drott). So I’m very excited about it. I thought my role for the panel could be to bring popular music studies as a discipline into discussions of historical materialism and music. There is a close relationship between pop studies and Marxism, one which dates back to the 1970s and the rise of the field itself. I wanted to bring some of that context into the conversation. Along the way, my project spun out into a paper about Stuart Hall (a social theorist who I engage closely with throughout much of my work); I also fleshed it out with a few examples related to my dissertation. In order to make it a bit more accessible and to provide citations, links, and the like, I thought I’d post it here. Here goes:
